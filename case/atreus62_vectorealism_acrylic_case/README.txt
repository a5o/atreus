IMPORTANT: the case was designed considering 3mm layers, however
due to variation in thickness some of the spacer layers were
nearer to 2.5mm. Because of this the rivets needed some rubber
washers to get a proper closing of the case. A solution would be
to substitute the third layer with small holes with a layer with
the larger holes.
